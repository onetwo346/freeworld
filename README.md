# Freeworld

A cosmic social media platform designed by Cosmos Coderr (cosmoscoderr@gmail.com).

## Features
- Intro page with cosmic vibes.
- Unique code-based login with IP detection using WebRTC.
- Stunning profile page with peer-to-peer social features using WebRTC.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/freeworld.git`
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to start.
3. Host on GitHub Pages by pushing to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Notes
- This uses WebRTC for peer-to-peer connections. For simplicity, signaling is manual (copy-paste SDP offers/answers).
- No server-side code (no Node.js) is used, making it fully static and GitHub Pages compatible.
